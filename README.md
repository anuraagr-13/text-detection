# Text Detection from real-life images

Performing text detection from real-life images using image processing algorithms and an OCR

Utilizing the image processing properties of thresholding, grayscaling and canny edge detection, the aim of the project is to read and recognize texts from images. 

Image processing steps utilized:

- Contour Detection and Edge Detection
- Morphological Operations ( Opening and Closing)
- Adaptive thresholding

There are different methods defined based on the lighting and the background of the images as it affects the preprocessing steps.

**Steps to run the files**

- Run the ocr.py file by specifying -i (image) and -p (preprocessing step)
    - The preprocessing steps differ based on a white, black or RGB background.
